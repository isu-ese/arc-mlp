## Design {#sec:design}

To evaluate the approach we elected to utilize two experiments. The first experiment evaluates the effect the approach has on the effort necessary to maintain a merged grammar as compared to its combined source grammars. The second experiment evaluates the effect the approach has on the complexity of the merged grammar as compared to its combined source grammars. These experiments utilize a Randomized Complete Block Design, with a single dependent variable (Effort, Complexity), a single treatment factor (Similarity Threshold) and the blocking variable size.
