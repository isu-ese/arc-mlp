The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In [section @sec:background], we provide some background regarding island grammars and how they lead to our research. [Section @sec:background] also describes alternative technologies used for multingual parsing. [Section @sec:approach] explains how SIGMA, our proposed tool for merging grammars, functions and the design decisions behind it. [Section @sec:methods] explains how we evaluated SIGMA on a small selection of grammars. [Section @sec:results] shows the results of our analysis.
