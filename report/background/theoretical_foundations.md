## Theoretical Foundations

### Context Free Grammars

A context free grammar can be described as \(G = (V,\Sigma{},P,S)\) [@haoxiangLanguagesMachinesIntroduction1988]. \(V\) is the set of non-terminal symbols. \(\Sigma\) is the set of terminal symbols. \(P \subseteq V \times (V\cup\Sigma)^* \) is the set of productions describing how the symbols of \(V\) can be substituted for other symbols. These productions are written as \(a \rightarrow b\) with \(a \in V\) and \(b \in (V\cup\Sigma)^* \). When \(b\) is empty, the production is denoted by \(a \rightarrow \varepsilon\). \(S \in V\) is the starting symbol. A valid string is represented by a grammar if it can created by repeatedly applying productions [@moonenGeneratingRobustParsers2001]. \(L(G)\) is used to denote the set of all valid sentences, or language, of grammar \(G\).

### Island Grammars

Island grammars are specialized grammars designed to match certain constructs of interest, called islands [@moonenGeneratingRobustParsers2001]. They are also designed to blindly match surrounding content that is not of interest as water. They offer several advantages over regular grammars for many applications including faster development time, lower complexity, and better error tolerance. Island grammars have been used for many applications including documentation extraction and processing [@deursenBuildingDocumentationGenerators1999], impact analysis [@moonenLightweightImpactAnalysis2002], and extracting code embedded in natural language documents [@bettenburgWhatMakesGood2008; @bacchelliExtractingStructuredData2011]. Of particular interest to our research is their use for creating multilingual parsers [@synytskyyRobustMultilingualParsing2003], which inspired this research, and the development of tolerant grammars [@klusenerDerivingTolerantGrammars2003; @goloveshkinTolerantParsingSpecial2018; @kursBoundedSeas2015].
