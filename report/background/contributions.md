Grammars are used to derive parsers used for several applications including testing, quality analysis, extraction, mutation-based testing, and graph based testing. These applications are tightly coupled to the grammar they use to extract the abstract syntax tree from code. To apply these applications for multilingual code bases, language specific grammars have to be developed by hand [citation needed] for each language the tool wishes to support. Our proposal to automatically combine grammars allows these applications to be built on top of a single grammar created from already existing grammars.
