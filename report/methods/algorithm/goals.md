### Goals

Our goal is to find a way to calculate a merged grammar \(G_m\) from two grammars \( G_1 \) and \(G_2\). We wish for it to be as compatible as possible with tools that use \(G_1\) and to be able to process all sentences that are valid for both \(G_1\) and \(G_2\). To better express this, we created the following desired properties.
