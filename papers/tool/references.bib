In order to simplify the construction of documentation generators, we introduce island grammars, which only define those syntactic structures needed for (re)documentation purposes. We explain how they can be used to obtain various forms of documentation, such as data dependency diagrams for mainframe batch jobs. Moreover, we discuss how the derived information can be made available via a hypertext structure. We conclude with an industrial case study in which a 600,000 LOC COBOL legacy system is redocumented using the techniques presented in the paper.},

One of the major challenges of this phase is creating extractors that can deal with irregularities in the artifacts that are typical for the reverse engineering domain (for example, syntactic errors, incomplete source code, language dialects and embedded languages). The paper proposes a solution in the form of island grammars, a special kind of grammar that combines the detailed specification possibilities of grammars with the liberal behavior of lexical approaches. We show how island grammars can be used to generate robust parsers that combine the accuracy of syntactical analysis with the speed, flexibility and tolerance usually only found in lexical analysis. We conclude with a discussion of the development of MANGROVE, a generator for source model extractors based on island grammars and describe its application to a number of case studies.},

The source code analysis of these applications requires the extraction and examination of artifacts, which are build using multiple programming languages along with their dependencies. A large number of studies presented on multilingual source code analysis and its applications in the last one and half decade. The objective of this systematic literature review (SLR) is to summarize state of the art and prominent areas for future research. This SLR is based on different techniques, tools, and methodologies to analyze multilingual source code applications. We finalized 56 multi-discipline published papers relevant to multilingual source code analysis and its applications out of 3820 papers, filtered through multi-stage search criterion. Based on our findings, we highlight research gaps and challenges in the field of multilingual applications. The research findings are presented in the form of research problems, research contributions, challenges, and future prospects. We identified 46 research issues and requirements for analyzing multilingual applications and grouped them in 13 different software engineering domains. We examined the research contributions and mapped them with individual research problems. We presented the research contributions in the form of tools techniques and approaches that are presented in the form of research models, platforms, frameworks, prototype models, and case studies. Every research has its limitations or prospects for future research. We highlighted the limitations and future perspectives and grouped them in various software engineering domains. Most of the research trends and potential research areas are identified in static source code analysis, program comprehension, refactoring, reverse engineering, detection, and traceability of cross-language links, code coverage, security analysis, cross-language parsing, and abstraction of source code models.},

	abstract = {Tolerant parsing is a form of syntax analysis aimed at capturing the structure of certain points of interest presented in a source code. While these points should be welldescribed in the corresponding language grammar, other parts of the program are allowed to be not presented in the grammar or to be described coarse-grained, thereby parser remains tolerant to the possible inconsistencies in the irrelevant area. Island grammars are one of the basic tolerant parsing techniques. “Island” is used as the relevant code alias, while the irrelevant code is called “water”. In the paper, a modified LL(1) parsing algorithm with built-in “Any” symbol processing is described. The “Any” symbol matches implicitly defined token sequences. The use of the algorithm for island grammars allows one to reduce irrelevant code description as well as to simplify patterns for relevant code matching. Our “Any” implementation is more accurate and less restrictive in comparison with the closest analogues implemented in Coco/R and LightParse parser generators. It also has potentially lower overhead than the “bounded seas” concept implemented in PetitParser. As shown in the experimental section, the tolerant parser generated by the C\# island grammar is proven to be applicable for large-scale software projects analysis.},

	doi = {10.14279/tuj.eceasst.49.708},
	abstract = {Currently existing syntactic definitions employ many different notations (usually dialects of EBNF) with slight deviations among them, which prevent efficient automated processing. When changes in such notation are required either due to maintenance activities such as correction or evolution, or because a grammar collection is written in a different notation than the one required by the grammarware toolkit, we speak of metalanguage evolution: i.e., a special language evolution scenario when the language itself does not necessarily evolve, but the notation in which it is written, does. Notational changes need to be propagated to different levels, such as to parsers that used to work with the old notation, to grammars of those notations that served as explanation material, and to the existing grammarbase.

The solution proposed in this paper, relies on composing a notation specification and expressing notation changes as transformations of that specification. These transformation steps are coupled to changes in the notation grammar (i.e., grammar for grammars) and to changes in other grammars written in the original notation. This paper explains the general setup of such an infrastructure, with links to the prototypical implementation of the solution.},

	abstract = {Grammars in a broad sense (specifications of structural commitments) are complex artefacts that define software languages. Assessing and improving their quality in an automated, non-idiosyncratic manner is an unsolved problem which we face in an especially acute form in the case of mass maintenance of hundreds of heterogeneous grammars (parser specs, ADTs, metamodels, XML schemata, etc) in the Grammar Zoo. In an attempt to apply software language engineering methods to solve a software language engineering problem, we design a language for grammar mutations capable of applying uniform intentional transformations in the scope of a big grammar or a corpus of grammars. In this paper, we describe a disciplined process of engineering such a language by systematic reuse of semantic components of another existing software language. The constructs of the reference language are analysed and classified by their intent, each category of constructs is then subjected to rewriting. This process results in a set of constructs that form the new language.},

Having a quality grammar will allow to test and validate it further, without alienating the community with a separately developed grammar.},

            Grammar dependent software development and automated grammar transformations have received considerable attention in recent years. This paper presents our catalog of six grammar refactoring patterns that specify the solutions to commonly occurring refactoring problems in the field of grammarware engineering. Patterns are formally specified using extended version of pLERO language, designed specifically for this purpose, while chosen pLERO extensions are also discussed.},
