### Island Grammars {-}

Before we formally define these problems, we will borrow the definition of an island grammar from Moonen [@http://zotero.org/users/1776655/items/H26DIBU9].

>"An *island grammar* is a grammar that consists of detailed productions describing certain constructs of interest (the *islands*) and literal productions that catch the remainder (the *water*)."

\noindent Moonen [@http://zotero.org/users/1776655/items/H26DIBU9] then formally defined this concept as:

>"Given a language $L_o$, a context free grammar $G = (V,\Sigma, P, S)$ such that $L(G) = L_o$ and a set of constructs of interest $I \subset \Sigma \*$ such that $\forall_{i \in I} : \exists_{s_1, s_2 \in \Sigma \*} : s_1 i s_2 \in L(G)$."

### Tolerant Grammars {-}

### Grammar Metrics and Measures {-}

The MCC and HAL metrics were define as part of the grammar metric suites initially defined by Power and Malloy [@http://zotero.org/users/1776655/items/U7GTMISU; @http://zotero.org/users/1776655/items/59S2DPJS].
