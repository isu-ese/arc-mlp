# Multilingual Island Grammar Generation {#sec:approach}

This section describes the methods we have developed to automate the generation of multilingual island grammars. In the following subsections we detail the algorithms we have designed to complete this task. We then describe the operation of these algorithms on simple grammars. Finally, we detail the design of the tool which implements these algorithms and provides a platform to facilitate data collection associated with experimentation with these algorithms.
