## Instrumentation {#sec:instrumentation}

As part of the experimental design measures for metrics M1--M5 must be collected for each generated island grammar. To do this, the tool described in @sec:tool_design provides this capability via implementations of the GrammarMetric depicted in @fig:model. During program operation, these measures are stored in a database and are retrieve and added to a data table for processing in the analysis phase of the experiment.
