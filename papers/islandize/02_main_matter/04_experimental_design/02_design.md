## Design {#sec:design}

To gain the most from this experiment, we have elected to use a factorial design. Thus, since we have 2 factors with 3 levels and 1 factor with 2 levels, each replication will need 36 sets of grammars. Furthermore, because the Size(G) variable is based on the number of grammars that are included in the set, we thus need 12 sets at each level of Size(G). Due to this, we need 204 grammars per replication. To gain the most from this experiment we will conduct 3 replications of the experiment, meaning that we require 612 individual grammars.
