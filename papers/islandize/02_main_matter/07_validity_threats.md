# Threats to Validity {#sec:threats}

This section describes the limitations and threats to the validity of this study. Specifically, we focus on threats to conclusion validity, internal validity, construct validity, content validity, external validity, and reliability in accordance with the framework proposed by Campbell and Cook [@http://zotero.org/users/1776655/items/UX227PF2], Campbell and Stanley [@http://zotero.org/users/1776655/items/8K87M9K7], Wohlin et al. [@http://zotero.org/users/1776655/items/28TSS6TK] and the insights of Yin [@http://zotero.org/users/1776655/items/KQJDZFIR] and Runeson et al. [@http://zotero.org/users/1776655/items/IIF2B7Z7].

### Conclusion Validity
Conclusion validity is concerned with establishing statistical significance between the explanatory and response variables. As discussed Section 14.6 the significance of the findings from the presented models meets our expectations. Thus, there are no threats to conclusion validity.

### Internal Validity
This validity check is concerned with the ability to show a causal relationship between outcomes and treatments. Given that this was a case study focused on the
observation of grime relationships and which did not use random selection or random assignment, we cannot statistically show a causal relationship between grime size (GSZ) and pattern type or pattern size.

### Construct Validity
This validity check is concerned with the use of correct operational measures for the concepts being studied. We utilized detection techniques based directly on
the definitions of each form of grime presented in Chapter 9 and by Schanz and Izurieta [43]. We also utilized techniques based directly on the definitions of the relationships for their detection as well. Therefore, there are no threats to construct validity.

### Content Validity
Content validity is concerned with how well the selected measures cover the content domain. The defined measures of grammar quality were selected based on the limited studies conducted in grammar measurement. Currently, there are no well developed quality models for grammars, which indicates that the selected measures may in fact not cover the entirety of the selected domain. Furthermore, quality is an inherently subjective concept and without expert guidance or well founded justification for measure selection, we cannot be assured that the selected measures adequately cover the content domain. These both point towards potential threats to content validity, but this is mitigated by the underlying justifications of the metrics upon which the quality measures are based. Furthermore, the model is derived from an approach already well founded in the software engineering literature.

### External Validity
This validity check is concerned with the ability to generalize the results of a study. This study was conducted across multiple grammars describing a variety of programming languages. Unfortunately, as the study considered only those grammars available on GrammarZoo we are unable to extend our results beyond these openly available grammars. However, through the use of random selection of our cases along with the use of multiple contexts, we are not limited to simply the cases evaluated and can advance exploratory inferences.
