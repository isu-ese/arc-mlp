Modern software development practice has led to an increasing number of software systems created using multiple languages. As an example, the modern web application is typically constructed using 5 or more languages (e.g. SQL, Java, TypeScript, HTML, CSS). Such multilingual codebases present a difficult challenge to the development and maintenance of source code analysis tools \cite{mushtaqMultilingualSourceCode2017}. Current source analysis tools typically address this challenge using a combination of multiple parsers (one per supported language).

Code analysis tools have become an essential part of modern coding \cite{kirkovSourceCodeAnalysis}. Using these tools, software engineers find bugs, identify security flaws, increase product quality, and comply with business rules and regulations. These tools have been integrated into software build processes and integrated into their pipelines for quality assurance and other services (e.g. SonarQube\texttrademark ^[[https://sonarqube.org](https://sonarqube.org)]).
