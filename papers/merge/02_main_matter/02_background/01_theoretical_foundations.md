## Theoretical Foundations {#sec:foundations}

A context free grammar, $G$, can be described as \(G = (V,\Sigma{},P,S)\) \cite{haoxiangLanguagesMachinesIntroduction1988}, where \(V\) is the set of non-terminal symbols, \(\Sigma\) is the set of terminal symbols, \(P \subseteq V \times (V\cup\Sigma)^* \) is the set of productions describing how the symbols of \(V\) can be substituted for other symbols, and \(S \in V\) is the starting symbol. Each production is written as \(a \rightarrow b\) with \(a \in V\) and \(b \in (V\cup\Sigma)^* \). When \(b\) is the empty string, the production is denoted by \(a \rightarrow \varepsilon\). A string, $s$, is called a *valid sentence* for a grammar if it can be created by repeated application of the productions of that grammar \cite{moonenGeneratingRobustParsers2001}. \(L(G)\) denotes the set of all valid sentences, or language, of grammar \(G\).

Island Grammars are a specialized form of context free grammar which include the addition of a set of interests. These interests are used to focus the grammar on the set of language components most of interest to the grammar developers. An island grammar is formally defined as the following tuple \(G' = (V,\Sigma{},P,S, I)\) \cite{moonenGeneratingRobustParsers2001}, where $I$ is the set of interests. These interests, as noted, define the components to which the grammar is focused, these are also known as islands. The remaining components of a language are reduced down into one or more catchall productions referred to as water \cite{moonenGeneratingRobustParsers2001}. This has the effect of reducing the complexity of the grammar. An island grammar, $G'$, derived from a grammar, $G$, has a language $L(G')$ which satisfies the following property: \(L(G') \supset L(G)\). Island grammars offer several advantages over regular grammars for many applications including faster development time, lower complexity, and better error tolerance. Due to this, island grammars have been used for many applications including documentation extraction and processing \cite{deursenBuildingDocumentationGenerators1999}, impact analysis \cite{moonenLightweightImpactAnalysis2002}, and extracting code embedded in natural language documents \cite{bettenburgWhatMakesGood2008,bacchelliExtractingStructuredData2011}. Of particular interest to our research is their use for creating multilingual parsers \cite{synytskyyRobustMultilingualParsing2003}, which inspired this research, and research into the development of tolerant grammars \cite{klusenerDerivingTolerantGrammars2003,goloveshkinTolerantParsingSpecial2018,kursBoundedSeas2015}.
