Immediate avenues for future work are as follows. We intended to conduct further studies to improve the results herein by expanding the study to grammars selected from the GrammarZoo \cite{zaytsevGrammarZooCorpus2015} collection. As part of this we intend to extend the capabilities of this approach to incorporate TXL and SDF grammars which will also reduce threats to validity identified in [@sec:threats]. The results herein indicate the promise of this approach and we intend to integrate it with ongoing work to develop tools which will support the automated construction of island grammars for use in static analysis and quality measurement of software systems.
