In this paper we have developed an algorithmic approach to merging programming language grammars together. The goal of this approach is to facilitate the automatic creation of Island Grammars for use in the development of multi-lingual software analysis tools. We evaluate this approach through two experiments on combined grammars selected from the Antlr grammar repository. These experiments evaluated the effects of this approach on changes to Halstead Effort and McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity of the grammar pairs as they are merged. The results show that the merging approach reduces the halstead effort and cyclomatic complexity when taking both grammar size and similarity threshold into consideration.
