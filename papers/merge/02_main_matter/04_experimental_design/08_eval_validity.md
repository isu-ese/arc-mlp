## Evaluation of Validity {#sec:eval_validity}

This subsection details the procedures put in place as part of the experimental design to ensure the validity of the results. As per Wohlin et al. \cite{wohlin_experimentation_2012} we are concerned with conclusion, internal, construct, and external validity. The following sub-subsections detail the procedures/processes used to ensure the validity of our experiments.

### Conclusion Validity {-}

The following characteristics of our experiments and data help to ensure the conclusion validity of this study. First due to the nature of the data we have put into place techniques which validate the assumptions of our statistical tests, and in the case of that we are unable to correct violations of these assumptions we have selected alternative analysis procedures. As part of this study several metrics are used to evaluate the selected grammars and those generated by our proposed technique. To ensure that the accuracy of the implementation of these metrics, they have been thoroughly tested prior to use. To ensure the accurate operation of the experiments we have implemented and tested an experimental execution system. For each experiment we are utilizing multiple comparison procedures, both of which have been selected such that they utilize proper error correcting procedures. Finally, due to the nature of the experiments there are no issues in the experimental setting that will cause random irrelevancies.

### Internal Validity {-}

The following characteristics of our experiments and data help to ensure the internal validity of this study. First, due to the nature of the experimental units and experimental system the timing of experiment execution has no effect on the outcome. Second, due to the nature of the experimental unites there are no social concerns affecting the internal validity. Third, the nature of the experiment which utilizes grammars generated by the combination of existing grammars and which does not affect the source grammars there is no effect on the outcome when repeating the same experiment. Fourth, We have selected grammars that are representative for population of ANTLR grammars and for different sizes, but which may be under-representative of grammars in general. Fifth, the selection, assignment, and analysis procedures used in these experiments have been selected to ensure that there is no ambiguity regarding the direction of causal influence.

### Construct Validity {-}

The following characteristics of our experiments and data help to ensure the construct validity of this study. First, the nature of the experimental units social issues affecting construct validity. Second, the design of the experiments and the technique being evaluated prevents both mono-operation and mono-method biases. Third, the implementation of the constructs underlying the technique being evaluated, there are no issues due to inadequate preoperational explication or confounding constructs. Fourth, the use of size categories for source grammars is designed to evaluate the spectrum of grammars rather than simply testing whether the technique works on grammars. Fifth, the design of the experiments and the experiment execution system prevents interaction of treatments. Sixth, due to the nature of the technique and the experimental process the source grammars are left unaffected and thus cannot unintentionally affect due to the application of the treatment.

### External Validity {-}

The following characteristics of our experiments and data help to ensure the internal validity of this study. The selection of simple languages (such as the group of small languages) not currently in use in industry would pose a threat to external validity, but this is offset by the inclusion of the other languages from both the medium and large groups. Second, we restrict our internal representations to BNF, but we do include the ability to utilize ANTLR grammars which are currently used in practice. Yet, because we do not include grammars in other formalisms (i.e., SDF \cite{heering_syntax_1989} and TXL \cite{cordy_txl_2004}) used in practice a threat to external validity still remains. Finally, the nature of the experiment precludes an effect due to the data or time of the application of the treatment.
