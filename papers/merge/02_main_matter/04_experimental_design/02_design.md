## Design {#sec:design}

To evaluate the approach we elected to conduct two experiments. The first experiment evaluates the effect the approach has on the maintenance effort necessary to maintain a merged grammar as compared to its combined source grammars. The second experiment evaluates the effect the approach has on the complexity of the merged grammar as compared to its combined source grammars. These experiments utilize a Factorial Design, with a single dependent variable ($\Delta HAL$, $\Delta MCC$), a treatment factor $Similarity Threshold$ and the grouping factor $Size$.
