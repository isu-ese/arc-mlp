Since this was a randomized experiment, one may infer that the difference in Halstead Effort and McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity was caused by the difference in similarity threshold. Becasue the subjects were selected randomly from the population of Antlr grammars, we can extend this inference to that population. But, extending this inference to the population of grammars as a whole is speculative at best. This deficiency, however, is minor; the causal is strong even if it applies only to Antlr grammars.
