## Normalization {#sec:normalization}

Next, the trivially merged grammar is normalized. The normalization process works to eliminate unused rules, simplify productions, merge equivalent rules, eliminate unit rules, expand productions, and collapse compatible productions. We leave the details of this process to another paper because the complexity of this process can't be fully explained in this paper without detracting from this paper's focus on the merging of similar rules.
