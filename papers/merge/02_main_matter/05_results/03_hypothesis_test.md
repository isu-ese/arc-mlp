## Hypothesis Testing {#sec:hyp_tests}

This subsection details the results of the HAL experiment and MCC experiment. In both cases we initially executed a sample size analysis to determine the number of replications to execute to achieve a power level of .95. The results of this analysis indicate the need to execute a total of 5 replications of each example. To achieve this we would need a total of 12 grammars randomly selected from each size category to form the necessary pairs of grammars used in the experiments.

### Experiment 1

We conducted an experiment using a factorial design based on the levels of the factors size and similarity threshold. Our goal was to determine if the algorithm when applied had an effect on the change in Halstead Effort for the combined grammars, as measured by DeltaHAL. Because of the violations to the assumptions of ANOVA, we were opted to utilize non-parametric methods in our analysis. The initial analysis utilize a permutation F-test approach to evaluate if there is any difference among treatment levels. The results was an F-Value of 9.569 and a p-va.ue of 4.73e-06 indicating that we could reject $H_0$. We also note that the interaction indicated in @fig:ex1_interaction was shown to be significant with an F-Value of 5.098 and a p-value of 7.31e-05.

We were interested in determining if there was any difference between the control level (1.0) and other levels of the similarity threshold. To evaluate this we used Steel's multiple comparison against a control. The results of this test indicated for each level that there was a significant difference and that each level the mean DeltaHAL was lower than that of the control value. Finally, we were interested in evaluating the selected levels of the similarity threshold (excluding control) and if there was an implied order (that is there is a decreasing order to the change in DeltaHAL) as the level value is lowered in the similarity threshold. To evaluate this we used Jonchkheere-Terpstra test for ordered differences among classes, which yields a JT statistic value of 767 and a p-value of 6e-04, when executed using 10000 permutations.
