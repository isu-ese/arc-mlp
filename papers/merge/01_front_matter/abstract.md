Multilingual parsing has been found to be a difficult task which island grammar based parsers have been demonstrated to excel at. In order to automate the process of creating multilingual island grammar based parsers, which has not been done, there is a need for a method of automatically merging grammars. Such a method is presented in this paper. This paper also evaluates the change in overall maintenance effort and complexity of grammars caused by varying the threshold value used to determine when similar productions can be merged. To show this, we conducted two experiments each using a factorial design. Data for both experiments was gathered from the ANTLR grammars-v4 repository. Both experiments show that any merging of similar productions decreases the maintenance effort and complexity of the resulting grammar. The decrease was found to be more significant for lower threshold values. This paper presents the initial steps towards the automated construction of island and tolerant grammars for the purpose of multilingual parsing.
