  abstract = {Contemporary software applications are developed using cross-language artifacts, which are interdependent with each other. The source code analysis of these applications requires the extraction and examination of artifacts, which are build using multiple programming languages along with their dependencies. A large number of studies presented on multilingual source code analysis and its applications in the last one and half decade. The objective of this systematic literature review (SLR) is to summarize state of the art and prominent areas for future research. This SLR is based on different techniques, tools, and methodologies to analyze multilingual source code applications. We finalized 56 multi-discipline published papers relevant to multilingual source code analysis and its applications out of 3820 papers, filtered through multi-stage search criterion. Based on our findings, we highlight research gaps and challenges in the field of multilingual applications. The research findings are presented in the form of research problems, research contributions, challenges, and future prospects. We identified 46 research issues and requirements for analyzing multilingual applications and grouped them in 13 different software engineering domains. We examined the research contributions and mapped them with individual research problems. We presented the research contributions in the form of tools techniques and approaches that are presented in the form of research models, platforms, frameworks, prototype models, and case studies. Every research has its limitations or prospects for future research. We highlighted the limitations and future perspectives and grouped them in various software engineering domains. Most of the research trends and potential research areas are identified in static source code analysis, program comprehension, refactoring, reverse engineering, detection, and traceability of cross-language links, code coverage, security analysis, cross-language parsing, and abstraction of source code models.},

  abstract = {Graphs can be used as a tool to determine similarity between structured objects. The maximal common subgraph of two graphs G and H is the largest graph in terms of edges that is isomorphic to a subgraph of G and H. Finding the maximal common subgraph is an NP-complete problem. It is useful in many areas like (bio)chemistry, file versioning and artificial intelligence. There are many papers that evaluate algorithms for finding maximal common induced subgraphs, but little research has been done on the maximal common subgraph that is not an induced subgraph. We have implemented and benchmarked two maximal common (not induced) subgraph algorithms: a backtrack search algorithm (McGregor), and an algorithm that transforms the maximal common subgraph problem to the largest clique problem (Koch). We created generators for randomly connected and mesh structured graphs, these generators have been used to create a database of graph pairs to benchmark the two algorithms. The results of our benchmark have shown that in most cases Koch is more efficient, because after creating the edge product graph needed for the clique detection. The actual clique detection is a relatively simple search.},

  abstract = {Graphs are an extremely general and powerful data structure. In pattern recognition and computer vision, graphs are used to represent patterns to be recognized or classified. Detection of maximum common subgraph (MCS) is useful for matching, comparing and evaluate the similarity of patterns. MCS is a well known NP-complete problem for which optimal and suboptimal algorithms are known from the literature. Nevertheless, until now no effort has been done for characterizing their performance. The lack of a large database of graphs makes the task of comparing the performance of different graph matching algorithms difficult, and often the selection of an algorithm is made on the basis of a few experimental results available. In this paper, three optimal and well-known algorithms for maximum common subgraph detection are described. Moreover a large database containing various categories of pairs of graphs (e.g. random graphs, meshes, bounded valence graphs), is presented, and the performance of the three algorithms is evaluated on this database.

  abstract = {Tolerant parsing is a form of syntax analysis aimed at capturing the structure of certain points of interest presented in a source code. While these points should be welldescribed in the corresponding language grammar, other parts of the program are allowed to be not presented in the grammar or to be described coarse-grained, thereby parser remains tolerant to the possible inconsistencies in the irrelevant area. Island grammars are one of the basic tolerant parsing techniques. ``Island'' is used as the relevant code alias, while the irrelevant code is called ``water''. In the paper, a modified LL(1) parsing algorithm with built-in ``Any'' symbol processing is described. The ``Any'' symbol matches implicitly defined token sequences. The use of the algorithm for island grammars allows one to reduce irrelevant code description as well as to simplify patterns for relevant code matching. Our ``Any'' implementation is more accurate and less restrictive in comparison with the closest analogues implemented in Coco/R and LightParse parser generators. It also has potentially lower overhead than the ``bounded seas'' concept implemented in PetitParser. As shown in the experimental section, the tolerant parser generated by the C\# island grammar is proven to be applicable for large-scale software projects analysis.},

One of the major challenges of this phase is creating extractors that can deal with irregularities in the artifacts that are typical for the reverse engineering domain (for example, syntactic errors, incomplete source code, language dialects and embedded languages). The paper proposes a solution in the form of island grammars, a special kind of grammar that combines the detailed specification possibilities of grammars with the liberal behavior of lexical approaches. We show how island grammars can be used to generate robust parsers that combine the accuracy of syntactical analysis with the speed, flexibility and tolerance usually only found in lexical analysis. We conclude with a discussion of the development of MANGROVE, a generator for source model extractors based on island grammars and describe its application to a number of case studies.},

  volume = {51},
  issn = {2590-1184},
  abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of cycle-free context-free grammars equivalence. To every context-free grammar there corresponds a system of formal equations. Formally applying the iteration method to this system we obtain the grammar axiom in the form of a formal power series composed of the words generated by the grammar ''multiplied'' by the respective ambiguities. We define a transform that attributes a matrix meaning to the system of formal equations and to formal power series: terminal symbols are substituted by matrices and formal sum and product are substituted by the matrix ones. In order to effectively compute the sum of a matrix series we numerically solve the system of matrix equations. We prove distinguishability theorems showing that if two formal power series generated by cycle-free context-free grammars are different, then there exists a matrix substitution such that the sums of the respective matrix series are different. Based on this result, we suggest a procedure that can resolve the problem of equivalence of cycle-free context-free grammars in many practical cases. The results obtained in this paper form a theoretical basis for algorithms oriented to automatic assessment of students' answers in computer science. We present the respective algorithms. Then we compare our approach with a simple heuristic method based on CYK algorithm and discuss the limitations of our method.},

It is argued that this type of equivalence is more significant than weak equivalence, which requires only that the same sentences be generated. While the latter type of equivalence is in general undecidable, it is shown here that there exists a finite algorithm for determining if two arbitrary context-free grammars are structurally equivalent. A related result is a procedure for converting an arbitrary context-free grammar into a structurally equivalent ``simple'' grammar (S-grammar) where this is possible, or else indicating that no such grammar exists. The question of structural ambiguity is also studied and a procedure is given for determining if an arbitrary context-free grammar can generate the same string in 2 different ways with similar parse trees.},

Even if a programming environment supports multiple languages (e.g., Eclipse), IDE features such as cross-referencing, refactoring, or debugging, do not often cross language boundaries. What would it mean for programming environment to be truly multilingual? In this short paper we sketch a vision of a system that integrates IDE support across language boundaries. We propose to build this system on a foundation of unified source code models and metaprogramming. Nevertheless, a number of important and hard research questions still need to be addressed.},

Pangea uses language-independent meta-models stored as object model snapshots that can be directly loaded into memory and queryed without any parsing overhead. To reduce the effort of performing static analyses, Pangea provides out-of-the box support for: creating and refining analyses in a dedicated environment, deploying an analysis on an entire corpus, using a runner that supports parallel execution, and exporting results in various formats. In this tool demonstration we introduce Pangea and provide several usage scenarios that illustrate how it reduces the cost of analysis.},

When writing a system which calculates metrics, especially when it has to support multiple source code languages, the biggest problem which arises is the creation of parsers for each supported language. In this paper we suggest an unusual Open Source solution, that avoids creating such parsers from scratch. We suggest and explain how to use parsers contained in the Eclipse IDE as parsers that support contemporary language features, are actively maintained, can recover from errors, and provide not just the abstract syntax tree, but the whole type information of the source program. The findings described in this paper provide to practitioners a way to use Open Source parsers without the need to deal with parser generators, or to write a parser from scratch.},

We study a sequence of restrictions that limit grammars first to Turing machines, then to two types of system from which a phrase structure description of the generated language can be drawn, and finally to finite state Markov sources (finite automata). These restrictions are shown to be increasingly heavy in the sense that the languages that can be generated by grammars meeting a given restriction constitute a proper subset of those that can be generated by grammars meeting the preceding restriction. Various formulations of phrase structure description are considered, and the source of their excess generative power over finite state sources is investigated in greater detail.},

Mutation was originally thought of as making changes to program source, but similar kinds of changes have been applied to other artifacts, including program specifications, XML, and input languages. This paper argues that mutation analysis is actually a way to modify any software artifact based on its syntactic description, and is in the same family of test generation methods that create inputs from syntactic descriptions. The essential characteristic of mutation is that a syntactic description such as a grammar is used to create tests. We call this abstract view grammar-based testing, and view it as an interface, which mutation analysis implements. This shift in view allows mutation to be defined in a general way, yielding three benefits. First, it provides a simpler way to understand mutation. Second, it makes it easier to develop future applications of mutation analysis, such as finite state machines and use case collaboration diagrams. The third benefit, which due to space limitations is not explored in this paper, is ensuring that existing techniques are complete according to the criteria defined here.},

In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

An additional procedure is given for rewriting the grammar so that each replacement string both begins and ends with a terminal symbol. Neither procedure requires the evaluation of regular begins and ends with a terminal symbol. Neither procedure requires the evaluation of regular expressions over the total vocabulary of the grammar, as is required by Greibach's procedure.},
