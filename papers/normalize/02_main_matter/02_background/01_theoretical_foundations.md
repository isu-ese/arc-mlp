<!-- ## Theoretical Foundations {#sec:foundations} -->

Context-free grammars are defined by $G=(V,\Sigma,P,S)$. $V$ is the set of non-terminal symbols, $\Sigma$ is the set of terminal symbols, $P \subseteq V \times (V \cup \Sigma)^*$ is the set of productions, and $S \in V$ is the start symbol \cite{haoxiang_languages_1988}. In examples of parts of grammars mentioned in this paper, upper case letters enclosed within angle brackets denote non-terminal symbols while lowercase symbols in \texttt{monospace font} denote terminal symbols. A subset of Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) is used to represent productions \cite{mccracken_backus-naur_2003}. Each production is written as $\Phi \rightarrow R$ where $\Phi$ is a non-terminal symbol and $R$ is an expression/rule. Each expression can be either a symbol, the empty string ($\epsilon$), or expressions combined with an operator. Operators include concatenation ($\bnfpn{A} \bnfsp \bnfts{a}$), alternatives ($\bnfpn{A} \bnfor \bnfts{a}$), and repetition ($\bnfpn{A}^*$). In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the concatenation and alternative operators. We also use parenthesis to delimit expressions when doing so prevents ambiguity (e.g. $\bnfpn{A} \bnfsp (\bnfts{a} \bnfor \bnfes)$).
