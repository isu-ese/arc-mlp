Multilingual parsing is an open problem that is currently being worked on. One method of multilingual parsing that has been developed is by creating island grammars for the combined grammars \cite{synytskyyRobustMultilingualParsing2003}. An automated method for doing this is currently being developed [SIGMA REFERENCE HERE]. One challenge to automating the creation of island grammar based multilingual parsers is detecting similar parts of grammars and combining them. This process becomes easier with an appropriate normalization process and normal form.
