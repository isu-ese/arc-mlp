Software applications written in multiple programming languages have become more common. These multilingual software systems introduce additional challenges for code analysis tools. One such difficulty is building parsers that allow these tools to understand multilingual systems\cite{mushtaqMultilingualSourceCode2017}. Current multilingual-capable tools use a separate parser or grammar for each supported language, or they use a limited intermediate representation (IR). Tools using multiple parsers are time-consuming to maintain, while those using an IR are usually constrained to an ecosystem such as .NET or the JVM \cite{petrinja_how_2013, linos_metrics_2007}.

One method of multilingual parsing uses specially constructed island grammars \cite{synytskyy_robust_2003}. These island grammars identify only the portions of documents that are of interest to the application. These island grammars are still able to function in the presence of multiple languages. However, this requires manually combining portions of grammars. To reduce the effort of creating these island grammars, we've developed a method for automatically merging grammars. This method demands input grammars be normalized. This paper explains the requirements of the normalization and presents an algorithm to perform it.
