This paper presents this approach and is organized as follows. [@Sec:background] discusses the theoretical foundations related to this work and the notation this paper uses. [@Sec:approach] details how the normalization procedure was designed, the meta-model used to represent grammars as they are transformed, and the algorithms used to perform the normalization. [@Sec:pilot_study] selects three grammars for a pilot study demonstrating the normalization process. The results of the pilot study are in [@Sec:results]. Finally, [@sec:conclusions] concludes this paper with a summary and description of future work.
