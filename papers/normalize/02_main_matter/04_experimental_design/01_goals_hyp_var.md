## Pilot Study {#sec:exp_goals}

To evaluate the above approach, we performed a small pilot study on three grammars. We selected these grammars from the ANTLR grammar repository. To select these three grammars, we looked for three grammars of varying sizes and applications.

To evaluate the grammars, we verified that each production was either of Form 1 or Form 2. We also looked at the grammars for changes in size. Finally, we looked for interesting portions of grammars.
