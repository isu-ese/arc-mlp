In this paper, we developed an automatic approach to normalizing grammars. This approach reduces the effort required to automatically merge grammars for the purpose of automatically constructing multi-lingual island grammars. We demonstrated and evaluated this approach via a pilot study on three grammars: Brainfuck, XML, and Java\texttrademark{}. The pilot study presents a step towards the automated construction of multi-lingual island grammar based parsers, thereby easing the construction of multi-lingual code analysis tools.

There is a significant amount of future work to be done. This normalization procedure was designed around grammars written in BNF. However, typical applications will likely use grammars written in more complicated forms. Further refinement of the normalization procedure using these features is one such avenue. Currently, our meta-model represents grammars written in BNF, EBNF, and ANTLR. We intend to extend this meta-model to allow representing TXL \cite{dean_grammar_2002} and SDF \cite{heering_syntax_1989} grammars. The generated names of symbols created in this normalization process lack readability. An avenue of future research would involve finding ways to generate more useful names. Additionally, this process is currently being integrated as part of an overarching approach to automate the development of multi-lingual parsers through the automated construction of island grammars based on existing grammars.
