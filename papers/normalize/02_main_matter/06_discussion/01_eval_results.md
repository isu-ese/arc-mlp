<!-- ## Evaluation of Results -->
Our results show that the normalization process functions as designed. Each of the normalized grammars meets the conditions of the normalization. There was a decrease in number of productions for Brainfuck's grammar and an increase for the XML and Java\texttrademark{} grammars, as show in table \ref{tab:final_num_productions}. The increase for the last two grammars was not unreasonable. Most of the increase was caused by the conversion of two specific ANTLR features into equivalent BNF features: (i) the optional qualifier $?$ and (ii) the zero or more qualifier $*$.
